A Firefox extension to open or toggle a pinned tab with WhatsApp Web within it. This extension also adds a shortcut, and a button toggle within the toolbar.

[![Get the Addon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/semanticdata/text-revealer-firefox-extension/master/firefox.png)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/whatsapp-pinned/)

## Usage

1. Toggle the pinned tab by pressing _`Alt+Shift+W`_. This shortcut can be changed by going to _`Add-ons` → `WhatsApp Pinned` → `Options`_.
2. If you prefer buttons over shortcuts, there is a toolbar button you can press to toggle the pinned tab.
